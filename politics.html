    		<h2>About Tripp</h2>
    		<p>Tripp has spent 40 years working in the publishing industry, doing so under various roles. He's a graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
    		<p>Tripp might be a recent resident of Villisca, but he's fallen in love with Villisca. He's been part of the community for more than 25 years. Before moving here, he enjoyed spending time in the town and enjoying Heritage Days.</p>
    		<p>During that time, he's seen businesses, like the grocery store, on and around the square that have closed. Tripp knows that a lot has changed. But that doesn't mean we should give up. Villisca is a beautiful place to live and we need to put in the work to keep it that way.</p>

    		<h2>Issues</h2>
    		<p>Tripp believes we need to think about the future and try to move forward as a community. This means establishing both a short-term (1-5) and long-term (5-plus) year plan. Some of the things Tripp would like to see the city do as a member of the city council include: </p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Stabilizing At-Risk buildings on Square</li>
    			<li>Repairing the Rialto Theater</li>
    			<li>Working with Montgomery County and State Economic Development agencies</li>
    			<li>Explore grant opportunities to fix buildings and attract businesses</li>
    			<li>Improving Housing Stock</li>
    			<li>More cooperation between the city and various community groups</li>
